    <h1><img src="assets/img/headshot.jpg">Hi! I'm Emily. Nice to meet you.</h1>
    <p>I’m a designer and visual thinker, who creates playful, engaging interactive solutions. With over five years of experience designing for a variety of industries, including media and entertainment,
        healthcare, and finance, I’ve honed my ability to adapt my design aesthetic to a range of brands and styles.An ambitious and quick learner with boundless imagination, I am always excited to take
        on the next challenge, and to explore its creative possibilities.</p>
    <p>I am an alumnus of the <a href="http://www.pratt.edu/academics/art_design/art_grad/grad_communications_design/">M.S. Communications Design</a> program at <a href="http://www.pratt.edu">Pratt Institute</a>,
        and the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bhaprogram.html">B.H.A. </a> program from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I concentrated in Fine Arts and
        Creative and Professional Writing and  minored in Business Administration.  Coming from a&nbsp;multidisciplinary background, I enjoy working across media,
        bridging my varied interests in my design work, from illustration to animation. I am particularly interested in creating original artwork and studying&nbsp;UI/UX design, illustration, typography, and
        information design.</p>
    <p>I am looking for exciting new creative opportunities.  I am open to both remote work and on-site roles in the Greater NYC area.  Please send an <a href="mailto:emi.lee007@gmail.com">e-mail</a> my way if
