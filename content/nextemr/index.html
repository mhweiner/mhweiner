        <section>
            <p>NextEMR was a revolutionary Electronic Medical Record application, perhaps a decade ahead of its time. It was one of the first web-based EMRs to be <a href="https://www.cchit.org/" target="_blank">CCHIT certified</a>, and the first with a focus on UX. It was also the first to utilize a fully-integrated load balancing task system.</p>
            <p>The mission for NextEMR was to be <b>easy to use, improve efficiency, transparency, accountability, and overall patient care of practices</b>.</p>
            <p>In addition to all the usual features required by the CCHIT, notable features included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cross-platform cloud-based system without the need for expensive hardware</li>
                <li>An integrated smart load-balancing task and notification system that kept track of follow ups, regularly or custom-scheduled patient care (ie, a once-a-month blood test) depending on diagnoses, appointment scheduling, approvals, prescription refills, misc tasks, and more. Tasks were assigned to employees based on role and workload.</li>
                <li>Patient follow up/scheduling recommendation engine based on diagnoses</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>Integration with billing and pharmacy software</li>
                <li>Patient access to all of their medical records with login credentials</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery with AJAX, driven by a modular MVC PHP architecture.</p>
            <h3>Involvement</h3>
            <p>I did all of the business analysis, product development, design, and full-stack development (I even came up with the name and logo). I was the only full-time technical person on this project from 2006-2009, until it was acquired by a VC firm in 2009.</p>
