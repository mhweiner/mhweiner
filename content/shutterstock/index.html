                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>Enterprise customers want to be able to view, pay, and export their invoices on the website. They also want to be able to speak to a sales representative if they have any questions or issues and pay over the phone. This means two different teams and projects (Enterprise Web and Sales) need to build similar systems.</p>
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Shutterstock's financial data is in a legacy system that is not easy to work with and has technical limitations and performance issues. We also needed to tie into many other different Shutterstock systems to validate requests, capture payment, and apply it to the user's account. We have two different stakeholders with different needs, and go live in a short 4 month time-line.</p>
                <h3>The Solution</h3>
                <p>The solution was to build an internal service &mdash; a REST API orchestrating layer. This service would do all of the heavy lifting to get around the technical limitations with the legacy system, and offer an easy, well-documented and well-tested API that any Shutterstock development team can take advantage of without headaches.</p>
                <h3>The Result</h3>
                <p>The project enjoyed a smooth, successful, on-time launch and was well received by users.</p>
