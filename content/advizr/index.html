            <p>Road Sign is an electronic proof of delivery application for Android and iOS that allows instant access to pick-up, inspection and delivery information by replacing paper forms used by vehicle transporters.. This eco-friendly solution gives the transporter the ability to conduct an accurate inspection of the vehicle(s), including direct photo integration, at both pick-up and delivery. These inspections details can be viewed throughout the lifecycle of the transport, eliminating the uncertainty often associated with when vehicle damage may have occurred.</p>
            <p>Road Sign allows for electronic signature capture, and the ability to email or fax the signed BOL as required by the client. A lifecycle history is available for review on the app, providing a summary of all events associated with the vehicle(s).</p>

            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS/Android/Windows cross-platform native apps are built with HTML5/Javascript on <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>, running a custom view-component framework built with <a href="http://github.com/mhweiner/hmjs" target="_blank">HMJS</a>.<br><br>Performance, modularity, and cross-browser compatibility were the main considerations. The apps were designed to "feel native," despite them being HTML5.</li>
                <li>PHP REST API, built with <a href="http://github.com/mhweiner/atomi" target="_blank">Atomi</a></li>
