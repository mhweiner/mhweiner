    <h2>Cinderella</h2>
    <h4>branding, illustration, interactive, motion</h4>
    <p>As an Interactive Designer at <a href="http://www.situationinteractive.com">Situation Interactive</a>, I designed landing pages, e-mail, banners, social assets, as well as storyboarded and animated the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_TdMOU410Q" target="_blank">"It’s Possible" lyric video</a> for <a href="http://www.cinderellaonbroadway.com" target="_blank">CINDERELLA.</a></p>
	<p>I enjoyed working on CINDERELLA since I was able to enhance the branding by incorporating other fonts and designing simple graphics to give it more of a fairytale quality. I especially enjoyed working on the “It’s Possible” lyric video and photo cards. At the time I was working on the video (in the Summer of 2013), there was a trend toward making interactive content and lyric videos for Broadway shows. I like kinetic typography and it was a great opportunity to experiment with it in After Effects.</p>
