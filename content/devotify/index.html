               <p>Devotify's mission is to build true loyalty and breed advocacy for every business. The Devotify platform is a gamified and engaging loyalty program for local and small businesses. Businesses receive their own fully-branded, customized app, in both the Google Play and in the App Store. Out of the box, the platform offers features such as gamification with different rewards levels, push notifications, blog, coupons and special events, geo-location, event calendar, QR code scan system, and more.</p>
               <h3>Technology</h3>
               <ul>
                   <li>White-labeled apps are a cross-platform hybrid HTML5/Javascript application with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>, running a custom view-component framework built with <a href="http://github.com/mhweiner/hmjs" target="_blank">HMJS</a>.<br><br>Performance, modularity, and cross-browser compatibility were the main considerations. The apps were designed to "feel native," despite being written with HTML5.</li>
                   <li>PHP REST API, built with a lightweight, modular custom HMVC framework.</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Involvement</h3>
               <p>I was hired as a consultant to design and develop the MVP, which launched in late 2014. I did all of the design and development myself of the 'white-label' app and back-end REST PHP API. Devotify has since added new features and built their own <i>Devotify</i> app which is a hyper-local discovery app, and is gearing up for a re-launch in 2017.</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Full-stack development</li>
                   <li>Business analysis, requirement gathering</li>
                   <li>UX, wireframes, and design</li>
               </ul>
