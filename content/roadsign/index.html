            <p>Road Sign is an electronic proof of delivery application for Android and iOS that allows instant access to pick-up, inspection and delivery information by replacing paper forms used by vehicle transporters.. This eco-friendly solution gives the transporter the ability to conduct an accurate inspection of the vehicle(s), including direct photo integration, at both pick-up and delivery. These inspections details can be viewed throughout the lifecycle of the transport, eliminating the uncertainty often associated with when vehicle damage may have occurred.</p>
            <p>Road Sign allows for electronic signature capture, and the ability to email or fax the signed BOL as required by the client. A lifecycle history is available for review on the app, providing a summary of all events associated with the vehicle(s).</p>

            <ul>

            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The app is a cross-platform (iOS and Android) hybrid (HTML5/Javascript/Obj-C/Java) application with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>, running a custom view-component Javascript framework built with <a href="http://github.com/mhweiner/hmjs" target="_blank">HMJS</a>.<br><br>Performance, modularity, and cross-browser compatibility were the main considerations. The apps were designed to "feel native," despite being written with HTML5.</li>
                <li>PHP REST API, built with a lightweight, modular custom HMVC framework.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Involvement</h3>
            <p>I did all the architecture, UX/wireframing, and led a small team in the development of both the cross-platform app and back-end PHP API service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full-stack development</li>
                <li>Business analysis, requirement gathering</li>
                <li>UX, wireframes, and design</li>
            </ul>
