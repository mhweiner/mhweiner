                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The app is a cross-platform (iOS and Android) hybrid (HTML5/Javascript/Obj-C/Java) application with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>, running a custom view-component Javascript framework built with <a href="http://github.com/mhweiner/hmjs" target="_blank">HMJS</a>.<br><br>Performance, modularity, and cross-browser compatibility were the main considerations. The apps were designed to "feel native," despite being written with HTML5.</li>
                    <li>PHP REST API, built with a lightweight, modular custom HMVC framework.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Involvement</h3>
                <p>I was hired as a consultant to lead development and UX. I did all the architecture, UX/wireframing, and led a small team in the development of both the cross-platform app and back-end PHP API service.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full-stack development (Javascript / PHP6)</li>
                    <li>Business analysis, requirement gathering</li>
                    <li>UX, wireframes, and design</li>
                </ul>
