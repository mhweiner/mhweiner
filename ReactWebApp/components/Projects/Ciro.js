        <h2>Project management and collaboration tools should speed up communication, not slow it down.</h2>

        <p>Existing tools are slow and painful. They either show too much information, or too little. Most importantly, they don't solve the biggest problem that teams face â€” too many interruptions. </p>
        <p>Frustrated by existing project management tools, I decided to create my own. It had to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Treat things you need to read or respond to like tasks.</b> It featured a "smart" queue notification system that track what you have read or responded to, based on underlying task prioritization and urgency. This limits annoying disruptions in your chat channel. Slack is not a queue. Email isn't (a good one) either.</li>
          <li><b>Be super fast</b>, intuitive, and easy to use. Keyboard shortcuts to quickly zip through forms.</li>
          <li><b>Be flexible.</b> Every team works differently, and does Agile differently.</li>
          <li><b>Have easy and powerful search tools.</b></li>
          <li><b>Have automatic sorting</b> by priority and effort, as prescribed by Agile.</li>
          <li><b>Clear head space.</b> Limit distractions and information overload.</li>
          <li><b>Support concurrent multi-project and multi-sprint scenarios</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>Although Ciro is currently still running, I am no longer actively involved or building this into a company. I have learned many valuable lessons,
          such as market conditions and something called "market fit." After launching the website at <a href="https://propelify.com/">Propelify</a>, and working on this
        for almost a year, I learned that it is currently a very tough market to crack. The amount of money to market this properly and build all of the features
        that companies would willing to switch for is simply immense. This means I would have to take on outside investment, something I would only have done if I
        saw this as something I would want to do for the long-term. As it turns out, I didn't have the passion necessary for what would have certainly been a long, uphill battle.</p>
