        <h3><i className={c(['fa', 'fa-flag', styles.challenge])}/>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Existing tools are slow and painful. They either show too much information, or too little. Most importantly, they don't solve the biggest problem that teams face â€” too many interruptions. </p>
        <p>Frustrated by existing project management tools, I decided to create my own. It had to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Have a smart queue notification system</b> that limits annoying disruptions in your chat channels. Slack is not a queue. Email isn't (a good one) either. Let's have a queue.</li>
          <li><b>Be super fast</b>, intuitive, and easy to use. Keyboard shortcuts to quickly zip through forms.</li>
          <li><b>Be flexible.</b> Every team works differently, and does Agile differently.</li>
          <li><b>Have easy and powerful search tools.</b></li>
          <li><b>Have automatic sorting</b> by priority and effort, as prescribed by Agile.</li>
          <li><b>Clear head space.</b> Limit distractions and information overload.</li>
          <li><b>Support concurrent multi-project and multi-sprint scenarios</b>.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3><i className={c(['fa', 'fa-flask', styles.solution])}/>The Solution</h3>
          <p>Advizr marries robo-advising with a thoughtful user experience and solid performing application to
            create an unparalleled experience for advisors and their clients. Features are based on exhaustive
            user-research, iteration, and customer outreach programs.</p>
          <p>We leveraged a component-based modular UI that allowed us to iterate quickly
            while still allowing the application to scale (in terms of complexity without
            major rewrites). This allowed us to hone-in on our features and iterate quickly with customer feedback
            and data metrics.</p>
