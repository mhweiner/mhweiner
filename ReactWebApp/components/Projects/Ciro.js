          <h2>I started my own company aimed at solving inefficiencies in the way teams communicate.</h2>

          <p>Existing tools are slow and painful. They either show too much information, or too little. Most importantly, they don't solve the biggest problem that teams face â€” too many interruptions. </p>

          <p>Frustrated by existing project management tools, I decided to create my own. It had to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Limit distractions and information overload.</li>
            <li>Treat things you need to read or respond to like tasks. Slack is not a queue. Email isn't a good one either.</li>
            <li>Be super fast, intuitive, and easy to use. Keyboard shortcuts to quickly zip through forms.</li>
            <li>Be flexible. Every team works differently, and does Agile differently.</li>
            <li>Have easy and powerful search tools.</li>
            <li>Have automatic sorting by priority and effort, as prescribed by Agile.</li>
            <li>Support concurrent multi-project and multi-sprint scenarios.</li>
            <li>Support floating team members.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>

          <p>I worked on Ciro full-time for
            a year and a half, signing up thousands of users and taking hundreds of feature requests. Although there has been some user validation, it turned out to be a very
            difficult market to penetrate. There is a lot of friction in getting a team switched to a new platform, and the project management space
          is incredibly crowded. I also made several mistakes, including not finding a co-founder
          soon enough. I take away a lot of lessons from this project.</p>
